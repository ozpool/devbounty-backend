## What it is

DevBounty lets a project owner put real money behind a bug report without trusting a middleman.
A sponsor funds a bounty in **USDC** held by an on-chain escrow contract. A security researcher
("hunter") claims it, fixes the issue, and opens a pull request. When a maintainer merges that
pull request, GitHub notifies the backend, which verifies the merge and **releases the escrowed
USDC to the hunter on-chain**. Hunters build public reputation through profiles and a leaderboard.

The escrow is self-custodial: funds sit in `BountyEscrow` until released. The backend's key can
only _release to a hunter_ — it can never divert or refund — so a compromised key cannot steal
funds. The blockchain is the source of truth for money; the database is the source of truth for
workflow, and may lag the chain but never contradict it.

This repository is the **backend**: the Express API, the chain indexer, and the escrow contract.
The web frontend lives in a separate repository.

---

## Capabilities

- **Self-custodial escrow.** USDC stays in `BountyEscrow` until an authorized `release()` pays the
  hunter. Access is split on-chain — the backend can release, only the maintainer can refund.
- **Automatic payout on merge.** A GitHub merge webhook is HMAC-verified, then strictly
  authorized (merged into the default branch, in the bounty's repo, by the claiming hunter)
  before the on-chain release fires. A maintainer manual-release covers a missed webhook.
- **Wallet identity.** Sign-In-With-Ethereum (EIP-4361) login with full signature recovery and a
  one-time server-side nonce, plus GitHub account linking via OAuth with tokens encrypted at rest.
- **Sybil-resistant claims.** One GitHub identity per wallet, a per-wallet active-claim cap, and a
  re-claim cooldown — enforced atomically so the cap can never be exceeded.
- **Single-owner payout.** The `submitted → releasing` transition is atomic; only the one caller
  that performs it can pay, so a bounty can never be released twice.
- **Chain indexer.** A single-instance (DB-leased) poller mirrors `BountyCreated/Released/Refunded`
  into MongoDB; reputation is recomputed from an append-only ledger, so a replayed event can never
  double-count.
- **Hardened API.** Strict CORS + Origin CSRF check, per-IP and per-wallet rate limits, pinned-HS256
  JWT sessions, idempotency keys on writes, and structured logging with secret redaction.
- **Free-tier hostable.** The indexer can run as its own worker or co-host inside the API
  (`RUN_INDEXER_IN_PROCESS`) so the whole loop runs on a single free service.

## Architecture

An npm-workspaces monorepo: `api/` (Express API + chain indexer, layered as routes over a
framework-free `shared/` domain core) and `contracts/` (the Hardhat escrow). The API owns the
on-chain payout; a single indexer reads chain events and syncs the database.

## Getting Started

Requires Node.js 20–22, MongoDB, and an Arbitrum Sepolia RPC URL.

```bash
npm install
cp api/.env.example api/.env        # fill in the values
npm -w @devbounty/api run dev       # start the API in watch mode
```

The escrow contract and on-chain payout activate once `ESCROW_ADDRESS` and a signer key are set;
without them the contract-independent API runs on its own.

## Testing

```bash
npm -w @devbounty/api run typecheck
npm -w @devbounty/api run lint
npm -w @devbounty/api run test       # 152 tests (Vitest + supertest + in-memory Mongo)
```

Contracts are tested separately with Hardhat (lifecycle, access control, reentrancy):

```bash
npm -w @devbounty/contracts run test
```
